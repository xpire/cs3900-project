Tired of being stuck at Level 1? Wondering what those greyed out features are? Here's how you level up!

Naturally you'll be Level 1 when you first create your account. There are 2 ways to earn experience:
1. Making trades: simply buy and sell within your current capabilities. Each time a trade goes through, you'll gain expereince equal to the amount of commission you pay. This means the larger your trades are, the more experience you'll earn!
2. Unlocking achievements: some achievements will reward you with experience when you unlock them. Go check them out in the Achievements page!

Here's what you'll unlock as you level up:
* Level 1: Market Trading, Stock Candlestick Graph
* Level 2: Stock Volume Graph
* Level 3: Limit Trading
* Level 5: Short Selling with 25% balance rate
* Level 7: Stock Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Graphs
