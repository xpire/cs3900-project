Week 1
It was planned for this week to decide on a project, form a team as well as selecting a SCRUM master. Both tasks completed without friction. The Jira site is also set up properly with all members added to it. In terms of technical progression,  I have researched into UI components in Reactjs to use for visualization as well as backend stock APIs and databases to use for the project. Some effort is also spent on redux and Mobx for frontend state management. The general architecture is also discussed, which we confirm that backend will be connected via python. For the next period, Github will be set up properly and tasks on the proposal will be assigned and (partially) completed.  

Week 2
Extension and base feature is further discussed and decided such that it can be put into user stories. Majority of the user-stories are written but modifications are still being made, it will be finalized next week. The system architecture is also decided, many questions on the requirement existed but eventually confirmed by the tutor (about using external API). Tasks are assigned to each member and I am taking care of system architecture, database and API testing. I have done some research on those areas and completed some part of the diagram. Finhub.io API is also looked into as well as alpha advantage etc. For next week, the proposal will be finished and the sprint planning will be finalized. development sprint will also start next week. 

Week 3
The project proposal has ended with all required components finished. Many discussions were carried out for decisions of architecture, use of technology as well as UI and UX design. Those discussions eventually landed in agreements and the task was complete. Much of the time were consumed by the technical sheer complexity of the proposal and not much due to ambiguity. During submission, the functionality of Microsoft word downscaled some of the images in the proposal and not much could be done about it, however, the images should still be readable. Starting next week, the development sprint will start and much of the time will be spent on coding and researching. Basic functionalities are implemented first, starting with search and authentication functionality. Me particularly, I will be starting with the ER design and implementation of the FASTAPI.
