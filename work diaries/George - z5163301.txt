Week 1

Formed group and decided roles. Discussed and decided on candidate projects, eventually settled on InvestmentSimulator project. Deconstructed and analysed base requirements of the project. We also discussed and decided on the rough technology stack for the project. I helped look into availability of stock data on the internet.

We had a meeting to decide possible extensions to add on to the base specifications for novelty marks. At this point, it is undecided what extensions we are settling on, we need to do this preferably early next week. 

I started working on the user stories for the Project Proposal. The user stories have acceptance criteria, user points and priorities. I also worked on the Background section of the proposal.

We also had a meeting to

Week 3

This week we worked on and finished the Project Proposal, my role in particular was to research about existing trading simulators, and also work on forming user stories for our project. We decided on a final set of extensions that we converted to their own user stories, we decided that we can cut any number of them if time constraints become an issue. Through many meetings and refinements, we finished the user stories and their corresponding epics, allocating story points and priority ranks to each of them. 

We transferred all user stories to JIRA so that they can be allocated to sprints later. I condensed my research into paragraphs in the project proposal, outlining the strengths and weaknesses of various trading simulator platforms. I also worked on other sections in the proposal.

Group To Do:
- Set up project development environment on personal desktop (get up and running)
- Start sprint 1
