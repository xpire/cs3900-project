Are you tired of constantly having to monitor the stock market, waiting for that dream companies shares to reach the price you want? Well, wait no more with **_Limit Orders_**, the time saving trading tool!

---

Limit orders allow you to place an order for a stock when it reaches a price that you set. You can also cancel these orders from the Orders page at any time _before_ they execute if you change your mind.

---

This means you can place orders at a price you're happy with, and confidently go back to staring at that beautiful portfolio graph knowing you won't miss that opportune moment!

---

However, limit orders will be automatically cancelled if the stocks price has reached the limit you set, but you don't have enough money or enough stocks to execute the order.`;
