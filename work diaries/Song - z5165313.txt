Week 1:
Formed a team for the project and discussed pros and cons of each project.
Settled on Investment Simulator since everyone was interested in it, and we had some cool ideas for implemention/extensions.
Did research on stock trading, and the features that existing applications had.

Week 2:
Began creating wireframes on Figma for base features
Still discussing possible extension features and 'novel' ideas. Ended up deciding on a 'gamification' route.
Held meetings to plan this out. The group will also be giving written daily 'quick' updates.
Continuing to research how the stock market works, and features investors want.
    e.g. pre/after market trading, limit orders, brokerage fees, short selling etc.

Week 3:
Worked on wireframes and storyboards.
