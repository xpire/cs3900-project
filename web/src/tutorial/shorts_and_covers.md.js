Ok, so there's just one last thing to teach you, and that's **Short Selling**. This is a neat little tool you can use when you think a stock price is going to **decrease**. Yep, that's right. You can still earn money while the company loses value!

---

You're probably wondering how this works, right? Essentially, you're borrowing stocks of a company from someone to sell, or **SHORT**, at some price. You then need to repay, or **COVER**, these stocks later, hopefully at a lower price than what you shorted them for.

---

When you **SHORT** sell stocks, this is also refered to as "opening a short position". You then close these positions by buying to **COVER**.

---

Also, if you noticed above I said "at some price". That's because you can also place **SHORT** and **COVER** orders as limit orders! Just imagine the possibilites...

---

However, this is a riskier trade - remember that stock prices can keep going up, meaning that you can lose money indefinitely! Due to this, I've restricted the amount you're allowed to **SHORT**. It's 25% of your portfolio value until you reach Level 10, where it will go up to 50%!

---

Now go **execute those deals**!
