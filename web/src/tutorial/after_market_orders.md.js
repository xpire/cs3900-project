const md = `**6 hours of trading not enough for you?**

Each stock exchange around the world has it's set trading hours - usually from 9-10am til about 4-5pm local time. Trade orders will only be executed during this time.

---

However, if you've become addicted to trading you can still place orders whenever you like. If it's outside trading hours for that exchange, your order will become an **After Market Order** - a type of pending order. **After market orders** will execute when the market opens again, at the opening price.

---

Be a little careful though - opening price will usually be a little different to the most recent closing price!

Have fun~`;
