const md = `**Welcome to trading!**

Let's get started with the basics: _Market Orders_. These are the traditional bread and butter of trading. You can **BUY** stocks in the companies you like, and then **SELL** these stocks later (hopefully for a profit!).

---

If the stock exchange is in trading hours, these orders will execute at the **_current market price_**, and hence the name. Keep in mind that the market will update frequently while it's open, so make sure to place your orders quickly when you see a good price!

---

When you **BUY** stocks in a company, this is also referred to as "opening a _long_ position" - as opposed to _short_ positions which we'll see later. You can then _close_ these positions by placing a **SELL** order on the stocks you own.

---

So essentially, you will earn money if a companies stock price goes **up** after you buy it. Don't forget that you'll be charged a little bit of commission every time an order executes though!
