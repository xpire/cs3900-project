Week 1:
Formed a team for the project and discussed pros and cons of each project.
Settled on Investment Simulator since everyone was interested in it, and we had some cool ideas for implemention/extensions.
Did research on stock trading, and the features that existing applications had.

Week 2:
Began creating wireframes on Figma for base features
Still discussing possible extension features and 'novel' ideas. Ended up deciding on a 'gamification' route.
Held meetings to plan this out. The group will also be giving written daily 'quick' updates.
Continuing to research how the stock market works, and features investors want.
    e.g. pre/after market trading, limit orders, brokerage fees, short selling etc.

Week 3:
Finished wireframes with Justin, 20 in total.
Also worked with Justin to finish all storyboards for the proposal (11 in total).
Reviewed all user stories and acceptance criterias with Ian. Some modifications and clarifications were made regarding limit orders
and after market trading
Work in Ian's garage with team to finalise propasal and submit.
    Issue close to submission: images in word became badly compressed when converting to PDF.
    'Solved' using Adobe converter, and also updating all images to more suitable resolution.
Will be working on setting up an environment and begin implementing features for Sprint 1.

Week 4:
Busy week unfortunately and did not get much done.

    Attempted to choose stocks that new investors might recognise
    Attempted to have a balance between industry sectors, price points and ETFs

Week 5:
