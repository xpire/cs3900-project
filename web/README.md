# Xecute the Deal - `/web`

This folder holds the frontend implementation for our application.

## Getting started

To get started with developing / running locally, clone the repository, and install the
dependencies using:

```bash
npm install
```

## Running Production

To build and serve the production application, you can use:

```bash
npm run build
npm run serve
```

This runs the React Application in port 5000, and will be accessible at [http://localhost:5000/](http://localhost:5000/).

If you would like to use another port (say, 3001), you can run:

```bash
PORT=3001 npm run serve
```

## Running the app development server

To build and serve the web app locally, you can use:

```bash
npm start
```

## Running tests

```bash
# Run the unit tests
npm test
```

The unit tests use Jest.
