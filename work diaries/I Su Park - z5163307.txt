Week 1
- formed group and decided roles and rough technology stack for the project
- created Jira accounts
- discussed and decided on candidate projects (InvestmentSimulator and OnlinePropertySales)
- after further research, we settled on InvestmentSimulator project
- looked into various sources of API for stock data, and found finnhub.io to be the best
- plan for next week: to research existing systems to gain ideas for new features, UI and extension

Week 2
- joined the team on GitHub
- suggested (and group agreed) to have scrum "meeting" everyday, i.e. everyone posts their answer to three questions: 
  "what have you done yesterday?", "do you have any blockers?", and "what are you doing today?"
- researched existing systems, studied about basic stock trading
- came up with extension ideas: gamifying the app (e.g. achievements, levelling up, and unlocking features as you level up)
- as a group, we refined and decided on the gamification idea
- plan for next week: finish user stories, sprint planning, set up a table for weekly retrospectives
